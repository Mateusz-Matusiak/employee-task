# Rest CRUD Application Employees
Postgres database is located in Docker container with my username and password. Change it to yours please.

## I have created 6 endpoints:
  > GET to get all employees from DB
 
  > GET /id to get single employee with unique id
  
  > POST to insert employee to DB
  
  > PUT /id to replace employee in DB at given id
  
  > PATCH /id to update employee's fields at given id 
  
  > DELETE /id to delete employee
